land rain turning arid lithuania faces growing risk drought extreme weather once known excess rainfall lithuania increasingly becoming land water shortages raising concerns potentially dangerous even extreme droughts summer according meteorologist gytis valaika speaking lrtlt valaika said dry conditions have persisted since july 2023 with little relief sight essentially every month has been dry and deeper layers soil have remained arid since last year he said even major lakes like dusia third largest lithuania have significantly receded people are photographing their wells and telling me theres hardly any water nature experts report that puddles which typically dry out only by late summer are already gone though droughts are usually associated with summer valaika noted that lithuania experienced unusual dryness even during past winter its not something you notice immediately because its cold and surface might be muddy but deeper layers remained dry he explained foreign researchers have even noted that atypical winter drought occurred baltic region something very uncommon for our climate according maps from lithuanian hydrometeorological service parts country particularly around sakiai and areas near kaunas are already experiencing dangerous drought levels and while recent cooler temperatures have slowed drought progression warmer weather could rapidly worsen situation as summer approaches and temperatures rise evaporation increases if we continue see little rainfall which likely drought could quickly escalate into extreme or even catastrophic drought he warned valaika emphasised shift lithuania climate patterns weve always been country with excess moisture now were increasingly facing moisture deficits rising threat extreme weather lithuania not just getting drier its also getting stormier valaika said general trend is clear atmosphere is warming allowing it hold more water vapour key ingredient severe storms whether its hail squalls or tornadoes all these dangerous phenomena are fuelled by high levels atmospheric moisture when its hot we must be prepared for extreme events he said though brief but intense downpours still occur they tend be highly localised youll have one town or district vilnius flooding while nearby areas remain parched these contrasts are becoming typical risk violent weather appears be growing every summer lately has brought surprises somewhere lithuania valaika noted last year we even saw tornado resembling type more common us very intense and not something were used to but looking at trends these events might become normal here neighbouring poland they already are heat waves now annual event lithuanians should also expect yearly heat waves defined as three or more consecutive days temperatures above 30c number hot days is rising and were also seeing more tropical nights when temperatures dont fall below 20c valaika said thirty years ago these nights were unheard lithuania now we experience them annually its getting harder sleep to cool homes and to live without fans or air conditioning he added that current temperatures are dramatically different from those mid 20th century if you look at data from 50 or 60 years ago summers were much cooler 20 to 23c was norm and 25 was something celebrate 30c was extremely rare maybe every two or three years is climate change blame while valaika stopped short definitively attributing each extreme weather event climate change he acknowledged likely link you cant say it outright without specific study but if something unusual becomes more common its probably at least partly due climate change warming temperatures mean more moisture evaporates from ground combined with low rainfall this creates double effect that intensifies drought conditions we had very warm winter and spring with only recent cooling that prolonged warmth has led to more evaporation increasing dryness overall dont rely on long term weather forecasts with summer approaching many lithuanians are turning online long term weather forecasts valaika advises caution there are different types models long range weather models and climate models latter project trends decades into future based on socioeconomic factors not just meteorology ill be blunt some these forecasts are just empty speculation they guess population growth economic development and build climate assumptions on that some may be accurate but many are not valaika is especially sceptical seasonal forecasts that try predict weather up to six months ahead ive written thesis on this their accuracy is low its more guesswork than science he said you might get sense trends week or two out but beyond that i wouldnt trust it lithuania geography far from large oceans that stabilise climate patterns also makes long term forecasting difficult its easier predict weather over us with pacific and atlantic on either side were less predictable best guidance for us is look at past trends

Title: Governments against universities – opinion

governments against universities opinion news political upheavals united states reaches us almost daily it was inevitable that sooner or later government initiatives would extend universities writes professor rimvydas petrauskas rector vilnius university there is wisdom in what richard nixon said approximately forty fifty years ago he said and i quote the professors are the enemy jd vance 2021 at first these took form more general warnings from us administration and recommendations revise policies on specific issues interest government management at columbia university has already complied with several government requirements however few weeks ago drastic and direct action was taken us president decided freeze approximately 2 billion federal funding harvard university broader review 9 billion grant is reportedly pending citing insufficient efforts combat antisemitism university campuses administration has also threatened revoke university special tax exempt status which it rightfully shares with many other educational and charitable institutions prior this university had received list requirements including obligation shut down certain operational programmes and areas as well as scrutinise students from abroad president donald trump most recent decree initiated investigation foreign grants awarded us universities it is action bearing strong resemblance russian government notorious campaign against foreign agents in response harvard president alan garber issued formal letter stating that university would not compromise its academic independence and rights he affirmed that no government regardless which party is power should dictate what private universities can teach whom they can admit and hire and which areas study and inquiry they can pursue trump actions have been condemned by more than 100 us universities which open letter expressed outrage at unprecedented government overreach and political interference and harvard has taken us presidential administration court there is more worrying news apparent alignment with shift president trump policy toward russia university minnesota has withdrawn its february 2022 statement condemning russian invasion ukraine it is reasonable assume that similar instances may become more frequent and academic community is observing developments united states with growing apprehension there is no doubt that significant number university community members now face real threat losing ability carry out planned research or even their jobs or places study some may simply refuse continue working in such politically coercive conditions it did not take long reactions emerge just few days ago ghent university belgium voiced concern over state academic freedom us universities it also issued warning its staff about potential travel restrictions united states and risks associated data sharing in specific fields subject heightened scrutiny by us administration relationship between universities and public authorities has always been multifaceted on one hand universities were established as communities scholars and students with freedom study and conduct research as defining principle on other hand universities came into being through privileges and endowments granted by rulers many of whom became eponyms these institutions and served supply educated personnel for expanding administrations said rulers inevitably this close relationship gave rise tensions and complications with some conflicts resulting mass departure faculty and students for instance disaffected oxford scholars relocated cambridge while german academics dissatisfied with their status at university prague emigrated newly established leipzig university throughout 20th and 21st centuries all authoritarian regimes have viewed universities as adversaries and have taken measures suppress them policies nazi germany towards universities are well known they were marked by strict control and discrimination and persecution academic personnel regrettably they were facilitated by many members academic world at time russian universities were among first institutions where both soviet and putin regimes imposed their rule and academic oppression which led intellectual and moral decline these institutions in his ongoing battle against liberal democracy hungarian president viktor orban forced successful international institution central european university ceu relocate significant portion its operations vienna universities in other countries are also facing unlawful interference in their academic activities by public authorities it is easy understand why universities have become targets for authoritarian governments by their very nature universities are centres free teaching and learning and more specifically and above all of free thinking and critical knowledge over many centuries initially europe and later around world universities have earned their status as centres free thought status that has become integral part their community identity this identity is passed down from generation generation and instilled in all who join universities historically universities have been at forefront movements resisting oppression whether vilnius uprising 1830 1831 or prague spring 1968 for their role these movements universities have faced punishment both closures vilnius university first by tsarist government 1832 and later by nazi regime 1943 were direct responses resistance from faculty and students universities also assume responsibility for morally flawed decisions made under external political pressure one such example is memory diploma initiative at vilnius university which serves symbolic act remembrance and redress honouring members academic community who were prevented from continuing their work or studies universities affirm fundamental principles free thought and speech in their statutes and mission statements principles they do not treat as mere rhetoric at vilnius university first of our four core values is openness to diverse ideas and perspectives to people and to identities naturally universities not only have right but also responsibility combat spread false information and disinformation and uncover deliberate distortions truth however they fulfil this role through their own expertise and by fostering open debate in doing so universities stand vanguard democracy assuming responsibility for its preservation and fostering it at time when democratic institutions are under threat in various parts world today more than ever it is essential that academic expertise and science diplomacy are successful in reaching out both policymakers and broader society universities will sustain their credibility and emerge stronger if they continue be spaces freedom research based knowledge and critical thought they are able adapt changing conditions as they have done repeatedly throughout history last year while attending conference at yale university and observing ecosystem research and study that has developed there over several centuries including many features that could serve model for us such as tradition endowment an inviolable university fund which we are still process developing i could not have imagined that exactly one year later i would be writing about threat this academic oasis three professors from this university including timothy snyder historian well known lithuania have already left yale and taken positions canada since their establishment at turn 17th and 18th centuries us universities have stood as bastions freedom and democracy in 20th century they played vital role and grew intellectually stronger process by providing refuge large numbers academics fleeing authoritarian regimes physicist albert einstein philosopher hannah arendt and historian ernst kantorowicz are just few notable examples this broad academic solidarity one can only hope that 21st century will not witness reversal this movement and that us universities will continue defend their status academic freedom vilnius university has many friends and academic partners united states and we deeply value these ties and are committed preserving them it is now our responsibility support our colleagues as members universitas magistrorum et scholarium through both symbolic gestures and concrete actions academic freedom and autonomy universities are values that no political power has right restrict together we must firmly state that we will not cooperate with institutions or individuals who support or enable erosion academic freedom or violate human rights we are prepared offer dignified working and study conditions at least some those who due political or financial pressures are prevented from pursuing their academic careers united by shared commitment freedom thought and conscience universities and their communities represent powerful force one that will resist and will not yield professor rimvydas petrauskas is rector vilnius university

Title: Lithuanian company makes EMF protection accessories – but do they work?

lithuanian company makes emf protection accessories but do they work growing market electromagnetic field emf radiation protection accessories has sparked widespread concern over potential health risks posed by devices like mobile phones laptops and wifi routers these accessories including stickers keychains and pendants promise block harmful radiation with some products priced as high as 600 euros however experts say these products are based on pseudoscience offering no real protection one such company lithuania based technano manufactures these accessories claiming that they reduce impact electromagnetic radiation from various devices on their website company outlines that their products are designed shield users from radiation emitted by mobile phones laptops baby monitors and even household appliances like microwaves and routers however when contacted representative from technano explained that company does not sell its products directly lithuania and instead collaborates with canadian company airestech which distributes products internationally airestech products range from small stickers applied electronic devices to larger plates that users place next their gadgets prices for these items vary from approximately 80 euros to more than 600 euros despite growing number consumers who swear by these emf blocking accessories scientists have questioned validity claims surrounding dangers electromagnetic radiation and effectiveness products designed mitigate those risks according dr benas gabrielis urbonavicius faculty member at kaunas university technology faculty mathematics and natural sciences assertions made by companies selling these products are rooted conspiracy theories not scientific evidence science behind electromagnetic radiation electromagnetic radiation is energy transmitted through space form electromagnetic waves it is divided into two primary categories ionizing and non ionizing radiation ionizing radiation which includes xrays and gamma rays carries enough energy break chemical bonds and damage vital molecules like dna making it dangerous living organisms non ionizing radiation includes radiation emitted by mobile phones wifi routers and other everyday electronics and does not have enough energy ionize atoms or molecules meaning it cannot directly cause dna damage dr sergejus orlovas researcher at institute optoelectronics at centre physical sciences and technology explains that while electromagnetic radiation from devices like mobile phones and wifi routers may cause slight increase tissue temperature it is not harmful in same way as ionizing radiation according world health organization who current evidence does not support claims that low level electromagnetic fields like those emitted by mobile phones pose significant health risk no scientific basis for claims harmful effects airestech website suggests that electromagnetic radiation can cause various health issues such as poor sleep quality fatigue brain fog hormonal imbalances and even heart disease company claims that its products help shield users from these harmful effects however dr urbonavicius and dr orlovas emphasize that there is no scientific evidence support these claims who has conducted extensive reviews available research on electromagnetic fields and concluded that there is no consistent evidence linking exposure low level electromagnetic fields with any adverse health effects specifically studies on radiofrequency radiation emitted by mobile phones have found no significant impact human health dr orlovas points out that claims made by companies like airestech are part minority view that contradicts scientific consensus he explains that these products misinterpret findings from international agency research on cancer iarc which classifies radiofrequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic group 2b classification that also includes everyday items like coffee this classification does not imply that exposure mobile phone radiation directly causes cancer marketing emf protection products despite lack scientific backing products like those sold by airestech continue gain popularity largely through social media and influencer endorsements company instagram account boasts over 150000 followers with testimonials from athletes scientists and everyday users who claim have experienced improvements their wellbeing after using products one key selling points for these products is their supposed ability harmonise or neutralise chaotic electromagnetic radiation however scientists argue that terms like harmonising or modulating electromagnetic fields are marketing buzzwords with no basis physics as dr orlovas notes electromagnetic fields are not chaotic but are structured according physical laws and there is no scientific justification for claims that these products can alter their characteristics moreover some claims made by companies selling emf blocking accessories are simply not physically possible for example airestech markets its products as being able convert chaotic electromagnetic radiation into form that is more biologically compatible with humans however experts argue that this is scientifically unfounded dr urbonavicius points out that supposed microprocessor in airestech products could not possibly interact with electromagnetic radiation in way company claims as passive devices like stickers cannot modify energy emitted by electronic devices questionable scientific claims airestech website also includes videos and articles that appear show improved brain activity after using their products these videos depict brain activity scans that allegedly show decrease brain activity when using mobile phone with green image representing improved brain function after using emf blocking product however dr kastytis dapsys neurophysiologist at vilnius psychiatric hospital questions credibility these experiments he argues that videos are more likely designed promote anxiety and encourage consumers buy products rather than present legitimate scientific findings dr dapsys notes that studies published on airestech website which claim show improvements brain activity after using products are not scientifically rigorous small sample size lack peer review and absence statistical analysis raise serious concerns about reliability these studies lack regulation lack regulation in emf protection accessory market means that companies can make bold claims without providing solid evidence as dr orlovas explains while some scientists and advocacy groups continue call for stricter limits electromagnetic radiation exposure vast majority scientific community and regulatory bodies like who and international commission non ionizing radiation protection icnirp agree that there is no need for such protective measures based on current scientific understanding
